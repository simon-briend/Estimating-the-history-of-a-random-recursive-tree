# Estimating-the-history-of-a-random-recursive-tree

In this repository you will find all the files needed to replicate the simulations used in the paper "Estimating the history of a random recursive tree", written by Simon Briend, Christophe Giraud, Gábor Lugosi and Déborah Sulem.

The main file is a python notebook. You will also find saved results of simulations to save you the time of running the simulations again. Most details and explanations are included into the notebook.

The code in this repository was written by Simon Briend.
